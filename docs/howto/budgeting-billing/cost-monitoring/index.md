# Enable cost monitoring systems

This documentation is about enabling automatic cost monitoring systems for
various cloud providers. This is different from the manual accounting we've
performed for shared and dedicated clusters that we pay the cloud bill for.

Currently we only have a automatic cost monitoring system for AWS, with other providers to come in the future.
