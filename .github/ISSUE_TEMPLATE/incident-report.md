# Summary

Quick summary of what user impact was, how long it was, and how we fixed it.

If it makes sense to include a timeline for this debrief, then do so below. This is usually most-useful for post-mortems.

All times in {{ most convenient timezone}}.

### {{ yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm }}

Start of incident. First symptoms, possibly how they were identified.

### {{ hh:mm }}

Investigation starts.

### {{ hh:mm }}

More details.

## What went wrong

Things that could have gone better. Ideally these should result in concrete
action items that have GitHub issues created for them and linked to under
Action items. 

## Where we got lucky

These are good things that happened to us but not because we had planned for them.

## Action items

These are only sample subheadings. Every action item should have a GitHub issue
(even a small skeleton of one) attached to it, so these do not get forgotten. These issues don't have to be in `pilot-hubs/`, they can be in other repositories.
