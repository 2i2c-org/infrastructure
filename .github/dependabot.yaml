# This is a *super* opinionated configuration file for automatic dependency bumps
# managed by Dependabot: https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/
#
# Folks were concerned about the noise generated by the bot and so we have made the
# following trade-offs to reduce this:
# 1. Check for updates weekly
# 2. Do not check for patch bumps
# 3. Phase in each package-ecosystem and allow the dependencies for one ecosystem to
#    settle before introducing the next eco-system
# Further steps we can take to reduce noise:
# - Limit the number of Pull Requests Dependabot is allowed to open at once. Currently,
#   the default limit is five (5) open PRs.
