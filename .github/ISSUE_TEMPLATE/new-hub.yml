        This template is designed to help you provide information about your 2i2c Hub so that a 2i2c Engineer can set it up properly. Answer the sections below as best you can. We can update information as we learn more.

    id: background
    attributes:
      label: Hub Description

        Two or three sentences about the community and use-case for the hub.

        See [the Managed JupyterHubs roles documentation](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/projects/managed-hubs/roles.html) for more information.
        
        The value here should reflect the type of authentication indicated below (e.g., a GitHub handle or email address).

    id: important-dates
    attributes:
      label: Important dates
      description: |

      placeholder: |
        - YYYY-MM-DD : we'll begin a workshop where people will use this hub
        - YYYY-MM-DD : we have a test this week where the hub MUST be functioning
        - YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD : we'll likely stop using the hub for the summer.

    id: target-start-date
    attributes:
      label: Target start date
      description: |
        The target start date when this hub will begin operation. This should be at least a week before any important usage of the hub will occur, to ensure that the Hub Representative has time to try it out.

        # Cloud Provider Information

  - type: dropdown
    id: cloud-provider
    attributes:
      label: Preferred Cloud Provider
      description: |
        If you have restrictions about which cloud provider to use, please indicate here. **Only choose a cloud provider if you have a strong opinion**. You may wish to specify a specific provider if you have a dataset that exists in one of the cloud providers already, or a billing account that you wish to use with a pre-existing cloud provider. If you have no preference, we'll use Google Cloud Platform.
      options:
        - No preference (default)
        - Google Cloud Platform
        - Amazon Web Services
        - Microsoft Azure
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: checkboxes
    id: billing-account
    attributes:
      label: Do you have your own billing account?
      description: |
        If you have your own billing account, we will need to set up the hub infrastructure connected to *your* account. This will be a bit more complex and take extra time. We'll follow up with more questions if you mark "yes" here.
      options:
        - label: Yes, I have my own billing account.

      options:
        - GitHub Authentication (e.g., @mygithubhandle)
        - Google OAuth (e.g., myemailaddress@2i2c.org)
        - ORCID

        # Hub Engineer information

        The Hub Engineer should fill in the metadata below when it available. The Community Representative shouldn't worry about this section, but may be asked to provide help answering some questions.
        
        ## Deployment information

        **Hub ID:**
          <!-- The unique ID used to identify this hub. Should be URL-friendly and short. (e.g. `my-university`). -->
        **Hub Cluster:**
          <!-- The cloud cluster where this hub will be run. For example, `pilot` or `cloudbank`. -->
        **Hub URL:**
          <!-- The URL of the hub, should be `<hub ID>.<hub cluster>.2i2c.cloud`. -->
        **Hub Template:**
          <!--
            The configuration template that defines the basic infrastructure setup for the hub. There are two options:

            1. `basehub`: a basic JupyterHub with a fairly standard setup.
            2. `daskhub`: a JupyterHub with a Dask Gateway enabled for scalable computing.
          -->
