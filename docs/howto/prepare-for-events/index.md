# Manage events on 2i2c hubs

A hub's specific setup is usually optimized based on the day to day usage expectations. But because events usually imply a different usage pattern, the infrastructure might need to be adjusted in order to accommodate the spikes in activity.

```{important}
The communities we serve have the responsibility to notify us about an event they have planned on a 2i2c hub [at least three weeks before](https://docs.2i2c.org/community/events/#notify-the-2i2c-team-about-the-event) the event will start. This should allow us enough time to plan and prepare the infrastructure for the event properly if needed.
```

The events might vary in type, so the following list is not complete and does not cover all of them (yet). Most common event types are exams, workshops etc.
