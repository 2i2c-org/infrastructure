        #          externally managed group of users, such as

        #          common expectations for an admin user.
        #
        #          The broken expectation is that removing a user from the
        #          externally managed group implies that the user won't have
        #          access any more. In practice the user will still have
        #          access if it had logged in once before, as it then exists
        #          in JupyterHub's database of users.

        #          OAuthenticator.allow_existing_users allows any user in the

        #          any previously logged in user or user previously listed in

        #          JupyterHub's database on startup.
        #
        #          To revoke admin status or access for a user when
        #          allow_existing_users is enabled, first remove the user from
        #          admin_users or allowed_users, then deploy the change, and
        #          finally revoke the admin status or delete the user via the
