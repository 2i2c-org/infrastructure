# List of running hubs

% NOTE: The CSV files used by this page are generated by `docs/scripts/generate-general-info-table-about-hubs.py`

Here's a list of running hubs and some statistics about them.
It is automatically generated from the config stored in the [`config/clusters` folder of the `infrastructure` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/config/clusters) and can therefore be limited in the information it provides.

```{admonition} Missing information for Azure hubs
Hubs that have `kubeconfig` listed as their provider are most likely running on Azure.
The reason `kubeconfig` is listed as a provider is because that is the mechanism we are using to authenticate to that cluster in the case where we do not have a Service Principal.

Unlike GCP and AWS, Azure does not require the location for authentication and it is therefore not listed in our config files and hence cannot be populated in this table.
```

## Table of all running hubs

A table of all running hubs across all of our clusters.

<div class="full-width hubs-table">

## Community hub statistics

Summary statistics of the communities we are serving with with hubs, broken down by cluster and cloud provider.
