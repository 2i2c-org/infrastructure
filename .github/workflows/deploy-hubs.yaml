jobs:
  # This job runs in Pull Requests and on pushes to the default branch. It identifies
  # which files have been added or modified by recent GitHub activity and parsed a list
  # to the generate-helm-upgrade-jobs function of the deployer. This function generates
  # two lists of dictionaries, which can be read by GitHub Actions as matrix jobs. The
  # first set of jobs describes which clusters need their support chart and/or staging
  # hub upgraded; and the second set of jobs describe which production hubs require
  # upgrading. These two lists are set as job outputs via GITHUB_ENV to be consumed
  # by the later jobs. They are also pretty-printed in a human-readable format to the
  # logs, and converted into Markdown tables for posting into GitHub comments.
