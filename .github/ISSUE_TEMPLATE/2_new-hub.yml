        # Ask for a new 2i2c JupyterHub!

        This template is designed to help you provide information about your 2i2c Hub so that a 2i2c Engineer can set it up properly. Answer the sections below as best you can. We can update information as we learn more.

        See [the Managed JupyterHubs roles documentation](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/projects/managed-hubs/roles.html) for more information.
        The value here should reflect the type of authentication indicated below (e.g., a GitHub handle or email address).

    attributes:
      label: Hub logo information
      description: |
        The hub landing page will have its own logo and a link attached to it. This generally points to a community or institutional website.

    id: hub-image-service
    attributes:
      label: Hub user image
      description: |
        It is possible to customize the user image for the hub, as long as the image is in a public registry. 
        For example, a [quay.io registry image](https://quay.io/). See [the Infrastructure documentation on custom images](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/en/latest/howto/customize/custom-image.html) for more information.
        Use this section to fill in relevant information:
      value: |
        - Repository for user image: { REPO LINK IF IT EXISTS }
        - User image registry: { REGISTRY IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS }
        - User image tag and name: { NAME AND TAG IF IT EXISTS }

  - type: textarea
    id: features
    attributes:
      label: Extra features you'd like to enable
      description: |
        In addition to a base JupyterHub, there are a few extra features that are possible. Use the checkboxes below to ask for them.
        These generally come with added complexity and cost, so make sure you've discussed these options with somebody at 2i2c before selecting them here.

        **Explanation of options**:
        - **Specific cloud provider or datacenter**: If you have restrictions about which cloud provider to use, and which data center the hub should live in (e.g. if it is next to a specific dataset).
        - **Dedicated Scalable Dask Cluster** with [Dask Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/): if you have very large datasets or otherwise need high-performance parallelizable computing via the cloud.
        - **Dedicated Kubernetes cluster**: If you need to run the infrastructure on your own cloud account, or otherwise wish to have a dedicated cluster.
      value: |
        - [ ] Specific cloud provider or datacenter: <!-- Specify which if yes -->
        - [ ] Dedicated Kubernetes cluster
        - [ ] Scalable Dask Cluster
