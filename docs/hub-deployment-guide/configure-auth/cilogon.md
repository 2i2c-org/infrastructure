# CILogon

[CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org) is a service provider that allows users to login against various identity providers, including campus identity providers. 2i2c can manage CILogon either using the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator or through [auth0](https://auth0.com), similar to Google and GitHub authentication.

Some key terms about CILogon authentication worth mentioning:

Identity Provider
: The authentication service available through the CILogon connection.

  When a user logs in via CILogon, they are first presented with a list of various institutions and organizations that they may choose from (e.g. `UC Berkeley` or `Australia National University`).

  The available identity providers are members of [InCommon](https://www.incommon.org/federation/), a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.

  Example:

  ```{figure} ../../images/cilogon-ipd-list.png
  A list of Identity Providers the user may select from.
  ```

User account
: Within an institution, each user is expected to have their own user account (e.g. `myname@berkeley.edu`). This is the account that is used to give somebody an ID on their JupyterHub. This is entered on an Identity Provider's login screen. For example:

  ```{figure} ../../images/cilogon-berkley-login-page.png
  The Berkeley authentication screen.
  ```

  ```{note}
  The JupyterHub usernames will be the **email address** that users provide when authenticating with an institutional identity provider. It will not be the CILogon `user_id`! This is because the `USERNAME_KEY` used for the CILogon login is the email address.
  ```

## JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator

The steps to enable the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator for a hub are simmilar with the ones for enabling [GitHubOAuthenticator](auth:github-orgs):

1. **Create a CILogon OAuth client**
   This can be achieved by using the [cilogon_app.py](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/HEAD/deployer/cilogon_app.py) script.

   - The script needs to be passed the cluster and hub name for which a client id and secret will be generated, but also the hub type, and the authorisation callback URL.
   - The authorisation callback URL is the homepage url appended with `/hub/oauth_callback`. For example, `staging.2i2c.cloud/hub/oauth_callback`.
   - Example script invocation that creates a CILogon OAuth client for the 2i2c dask-staging hub:
      ```bash
      python3 ./deployer/cilogon_app.py create 2i2c dask-staging daskhub https://dask-staging.2i2c.cloud/hub/oauth_callback
      ```
   - If successfull, the script will have created a secret values file under `config/clusters/<cluster_name>/enc-<hub_name>.secret.values.yaml`. This file
   holds the encrypted OAuth client id and secret that have been created for this hub.
   - The unecrypted file contents should look like this:
      ```yaml
        jupyterhub:
          hub:
            config:
              CILogonOAuthenticator:
                client_id: CLIENT_ID
                client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
        ```

2. **Set the hub to _not_ configure Auth0 in the `config/clusters/<cluster_name>/cluster.yaml` file.**
   To ensure the deployer does not provision and configure an OAuth app from Auth0, the following config should be added to the appropriate hub in the cluster's `cluster.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   hubs:
     - name: <hub_name>
       auth0:
         enabled: false
   ```

3. **If not already present, add the secret hub config file to the list of helm chart values file in `config/clusters<cluster_name>/cluster.yaml`.**
   If you created the `enc-<hub_name>.secret.values.yaml` file in step 2, add it the the `cluster.yaml` file like so:

   ```yaml
   ...
   hubs:
     - name: <hub_name>
       ...
       helm_chart_values_files:
         - <hub_name>.values.yaml
         - enc-<hub_name>.secret.values.yaml
     ...
   ```

4. **Edit the non-secret config under `config/clusters/<cluster_name>/<hub_name>.values.yaml`.**

   4.1. **A few rules of thumb when using this method of authentication:**

    - The `admin_users` list need to match `allowed_idps` rules too.

    - It is recommended to define in the `allowed_idps` dict, all the identity providers we plan to allow to be used for a hub. This way, only these will be allowed to be used.

      ```{note}
      The keys allowed in the `allowed_idps` dict **must be valid CILogon `EntityIDs`**.
      Go to https://cilogon.org/idplist for the list of EntityIDs of each IdP.
      ```

    - All the identity providers must define a `username_derivation` scheme, with their own `username_claim`, that the user *cannot change*. If they can, it can be easily used to impersonate others! For example, if we allow both GitHub and `utoronto.ca` as allowed authentication providers, and only use `email` as `username_claim`, for both providers, any GitHub user can set their email field in their GitHub profile to a `utoronto.ca` email and thus gain access to any `utoronto.ca` user's server! So a very careful choice needs to
    be made here.

      ```{note}
      You can check the [CILogon scopes section](https://www.cilogon.org/oidc#h.p_PEQXL8QUjsQm) to checkout available values for `username_claim`. This *cannot* be changed afterwards without manual migration of user names, so choose this carefully.
      ```

   4.2. **Most common configurations for 2i2c clusters:**

    1. **Only display specific identity provider as a login options**

        *This example uses GitHub as the only identity provider to show to the user.*

        ```yaml
        jupyterhub:
          hub:
            config:
              JupyterHub:
                authenticator_class: cilogon
              CILogonOAuthenticator:
                # This config option will only display GitHub as the only identity provider option
                shown_idps:
                  - https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
        ```

    2. **Authenticate using Google with CILogon, allowing only a certain domain**:

        *This example sets `2i2c.org` as the only domain that can login into the hub using Google*

        ```yaml
        jupyterhub:
          hub:
            config:
              JupyterHub:
                authenticator_class: cilogon
              CILogonOAuthenticator:
                oauth_callback_url: https://{{ HUB_DOMAIN }}/hub/oauth_callback
                allowed_idps:
                  http://google.com/accounts/o8/id:
                    username_derivation:
                      username_claim: "email"
                    allowed_domains:
                        - "2i2c.org"
        ```

    3. **Authenticate using an instutional identity provider for the hub community users and Google for 2i2c staff.**

        This example:
          - only shows Shibboleth, the ANU identity provider, and Google as the possible login options through CILogon
          - sets `2i2c.org` as the only domain that can login to the hub using Google
          - sets `anu.edu.au` as the only domain that can login to the hub using Shibboleth
          - adds a `2i2c:` prefix to the usernames logging in through Google. The hub usernames are the `email` addresses of these accounts, as specified through `username_claim`.
          - strips the `@anu.edu.au` domain from the usernames logging in through Shibboleth. The hub usernames are the `email` addresses of these accounts, as specified through `username_claim`.

      ```{note}
      To get the value of the key that must go in the `allowed_idp` dict for a specific IdP, go to https://cilogon.org/idplist and get the value of the `EntityID` key of the desired institutional IdP.
      ```

      Example config:

      ```yaml
      jupyterhub:
        hub:
          config:
            JupyterHub:
              authenticator_class: cilogon
            CILogonOAuthenticator:
              oauth_callback_url: https://{{ HUB_DOMAIN }}/hub/oauth_callback
              admin_users:
                - admin@anu.edu.au
              # Only show the option to login with Google and Shibboleth
              shown_idps:
                - https://idp2.anu.edu.au/idp/shibboleth
                - https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
              allowed_idps:
                http://google.com/accounts/o8/id:
                  username_derivation:
                    username_claim: "email"
                    action: "prefix"
                    prefix: "2i2c"
                  allowed_domains:
                    - "2i2c.org"
                https://idp2.anu.edu.au/idp/shibboleth:
                  username_derivation:
                    username_claim: "email"
                    action: "strip_idp_domain",
                    domain: "anu.edu.au"
                  allowed_domains:
                    - "anu.edu.au"
      ```

   ```{note}
   To learn about all the possible config options of the `CILogonOAuthenticator` dict, checkout [the docs](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/gen/oauthenticator.cilogon.html#oauthenticator.cilogon.CILogonOAuthenticator.allowed_idps).
   ```

5. Run the deployer as normal to apply the config.

## CILogon through Auth0

```{seealso}
See the [CILogon documentation on `Auth0`](https://www.cilogon.org/auth0) for more configuration information.
```

The steps to enable the CILogon authentication through Auth0 for a hub are:

1. List CILogon as the type of connection we want for a hub, via `auth0.connection` in the `cluster.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   auth0:
      connection: CILogon
   ```

2. Add **admin users** to the hub by explicitly listing their email addresses. Add **allowed users** for the hub by providing a regex pattern that will match to an institutional email address. (see example below)

  ```{note}
  Don't forget to allow login to the test user (`deployment-service-check`), otherwise the hub health check performed during deployment will fail.
  ```

### Example config for CILogon through Auth0

The CILogon connection works by providing users the option to login into a hub using any CILogon Identity Provider of their choice, as long as the email address of the user or the entire organization (e.g. `*@berkeley.edu`) has been provided access into the hub.

The following configuration example shows off how to configure hub admins and allowed users:

1. **Hub admins** are these explicit emails:
   - one `@campus.edu` user
   - one `@gmail.com` user
   - the 2i2c staff (identified through their 2i2c email address)

2. **Allowed users** are matched against a pattern, with a few specific addresses added in as well
   - all `@2i2c.org` email adresses
   - all `@campus.edu` email addresses
   - `user2@gmail.com`
   - the test username, `deployment-service-check`

```yaml
jupyterhub:
  custom:
    2i2c:
      add_staff_user_ids_to_admin_users: true
      add_staff_user_ids_of_type: "google"
  hub:
    config:
      Authenticator:
        admin_users:
          - user1@campus.edu
          - user2@gmail.com
        username_pattern: '^(.+@2i2c\.org|.+@campus\.edu|user2@gmail\.com|deployment-service-check)$'
```

```{note}
All the users listed under `admin_users` need to match the `username_pattern` expression otherwise they won't be allowed to login!
```

## Switch Identity Providers or user accounts

By default, logging in with a particular user account will persist your credentials in future sessions.
This means that you'll automatically re-use the same institutional and user account when you access the hub's home page.

### Switch Identity Providers

1. **Logout of the Hub** using the logout button or by going to `https://{hub-name}/hub/logout`.
2. **Clear browser cookies** (optional). If the user asked CILogon to re-use the same Identity Provider connection when they logged in, they'll need to [clear browser cookies](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981) for <https://cilogon.org>.

   ```{figure} ../../images/cilogon-remember-this-selection.png
   The dialog box that allows you to re-use the same Identity Provider.
   ```

   Firefox example:
   ```{figure} ../../images/cilogon-clear-cookies.png
   An example of clearing cookies with Firefox.
   ```

3. The next time the user goes to the hub's landing page, they'll be asked to re-authenticate and will be presented with the list of available Identity Providers after choosing the CILogon connection.
4. They can now choose **another Identity Provider** via CILogon.

```{note}
If the user choses the same Identity Provider, then they will be automatically logged in with the same user account they've used before. To change the user account, see [](auth:cilogon:switch-user-accounts).
```

(auth:cilogon:switch-user-accounts)=
### Switch user account

1. Logout of the Hub using the logout button or by going to `https://{hub-name}/hub/logout`.
2. Logout of CILogon by going to the [CILogon logout page](https://cilogon.org/logout).
3. The next time the user goes to the hub's landing page, they'll be asked to re-authenticate and will be presented with the list of available Identity Providers after choosing the CILogon connection.
4. Choose the **same Identity Provider** to login.
5. The user can now choose **another user account** to login with.

### 403 - Unauthorized errors

If you see a 403 error page, this means that the account you were using to login hasn't been allowed by the hub administrator.

```{figure} ../../images/403-forbidden.png
```

If you think this is an error, and the account should have been allowed, then contact the hub adminstrator/s.

If you used the wrong user account, you can log in using another account by following the steps in [](auth:cilogon:switch-user-accounts).
