Hey @{{ .community_rep }} and @{{ .issue_author }}! ðŸ‘‹
I noticed there is still pending information about the new hub deployment.
Can you please help us fill it in?

The information pieces still missing, are:
**{{ .pending_info }}**

Details about each of them can be found in the top comment. But if you have questions about any of them, please ping the `2i2c/engineering` team and they will help you.

After the form in the top comment is filled in, an engineer will be assigned and will start deploying the new hub ðŸš€. Thank you!
