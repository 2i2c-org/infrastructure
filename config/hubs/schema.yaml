          Path to a `sops` encrypted service account JSON key that

          If the cluster is a zonal cluster, this specifies the zone

                  Domain the hub should be running on. This domain should resolve
                  to the IP of the ingress controller on the cluster - most likely
                  via a wildcard DNS entry. 

                  For example, there's a entry for '*.pilot.2i2c.cloud' pointing to
                  the ingress controller of the cluster running hubs in `2i2c.cluster.yaml`.
                  Similar for '*.cloudbank.2i2c.cloud', etc.
