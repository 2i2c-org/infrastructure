### Summary

This is a helper script that will tell us how many duplicated auth apps we
currently have on Auth0

### Requirements

All requirements are already listed in `requirements.txt` with the exception of
rich, which is listed in `dev-requirements.txt`.

### Running the script

Execute the script from the root of the repository:

- python extra_scripts/count-auth0-apps.py

This will output to the console a list of app names that have more than one
client id (i.e. they have duplicates)

Adding the purge flag will delete apps on Auth0 until each app name only has one
client id associated with it

- python extra_scripts/count-auth0-apps.py --purge
