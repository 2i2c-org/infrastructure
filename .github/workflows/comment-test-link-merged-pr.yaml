  # In order to comment on a Pull Request, we need its number. But because we do not
  # trigger this workflow in a Pull Request context, it is not readily available to us.
  # Instead, we extract the PR number from the message of the head commit in the push
  # event payload. In the case of a merged PR, this message will be of the form:
  # 'Merge pull request #XXX from owner/branch'

  # job) and pr-number (str)
