      For each hub to be deployed, copy the tables below and fill them in.
      The tables must be complete for each hub to be considered READY to be
      deployed. For a staging/prod pair, a statement such as "Same as staging
      but for production" will suffice for the prod hub's specification. Use
      the Notes column to provide any contextual information.
