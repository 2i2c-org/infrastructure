# Add a new hub

Adding a new hub requires that we do three things:

1. [Create a new GitHub issue for the hub](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues/new).
2. Create the hub via appending a new hub entry in the appropriate cluster file under
   `config/hubs` file (see [](../../topic/config.md) for more information).
3. Start following [team process](team-process) around operating the hubs.
