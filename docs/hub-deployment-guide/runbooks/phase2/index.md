# Phase 2: Cluster setup

This assumes all engineers have access to this new account, and will be able to set up the cluster and support, without any new hubs being set up.

## Definition of ready

The following table lists the information that needs to be available to the engineer before this phase can start.

- Region / Zone of the cluster
- Name of cluster
- Is GPU required?

## Outputs

At the end of Phase 1, there should be a new cluster setup, with fully configured and deployed support components.

The file assets that should have been generated at the end of this phase and included in the PR should be:

```bash
➕ config/clusters/<new-cluster-name>
  ├── cluster.yaml
  ├── deployer-credentials.secret.json
  ├── enc-deployer-credentials.secret.json
  ├── enc-support.secret.values.yaml
  ├── enc-grafana-token.secret.yaml
  └── support.values.yaml
```

```bash
➕ terraform
  └── <new-cluster>.terraform
```

If on AWS:

```bash
➕ eksctl
  ├── <new-cluster>.jsonnet
  ├── ssh-keys/
    ├── <new-cluster>.key.pub
    ├── secret
    └   └── <new-cluster>.key
```

And the following existing file should be updated to accommodate the new clusteR:

```bash
～ .github/workflows
  └── deploy-grafana-dashboards.yaml
```

```{tip}
When reviewing cluster setup PRs, make sure the files above are all present.
```

## Cluster setup runbook

All of the following steps must be followed in order to consider phase 2 complete. Steps contain references to other smaller, topic-specifc runbooks that this just gathers all together and lists them in the order they should be carried on by an engineer.

1. **Create the new cluster**

   Follow the provider-specific steps in [](new-cluster:new-cluster) to create the cluster.

2. **Configure and deploy the support chart**

   Follow the steps in [](deploy-support-chart) to configure and deploy the support chart.

3. **Setup Grafana dashboards**

   Follow the steps in [](setup-grafana) to setup Grafana dashboards for the newly created cluster.

4. **Register the new cluster with the central 2i2c Grafana**

   Follow the steps in [](register-new-cluster-with-central-grafana) so that the cluster you just added will be findable from the 2i2c central Grafana.
