  # Prometheus for collection of metrics.
  # https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus
  #
  # We have deliberately chosen to use the helm chart rather than the prometheus
  # operator, as we will never have more than one prometheus installation per
  # cluster. The operator thus adds functionality we will not use, at a complexity
  # cost. If we ever have multiple prometheii on the same cluster, we can
  # reconsider using the operator.
