        #        This is an interim setup, trying to balance the experience of
        #        the previous 1:1 user:node setup with a node sharing setup. It
        #        is not meant to be retained long term!
        #
        #        -[ ] Make this cluster have a node sharing setup like in the
        #             basehub/daskhub template.
