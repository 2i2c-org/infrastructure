# Tests for `deployer` package

This directory contains tests dedicated to ensuring the `deployer` package is behaving in the manner the 2i2c Engineering team designed and expect it to behave.

To run this test suite, **from the root of the repo**, install the requirements, and then activate the tests using `pytest`.
(You may wish to create a virtual environment first before executing these commands using `venv` or `conda`.)

```bash
pip install .
python -m pytest -vvv
```
