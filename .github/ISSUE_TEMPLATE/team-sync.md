This is a 2i2c Tech Team sync ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰! This is a way for 2i2c Team Members to triage work, point out issues that require attention, and make sure we are working well as a team.

### Team Goals

See the [Team Goal label](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Agoal) for a list of team goals that we are currently working towards.

### Issues Requiring attention

These issues require attention quickly:

- **New Hubs**: The [Needs Hub issues](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Needs+Hub%22) are new hubs that need deployments.
- **Needs Triage**: The [Needs Triage issues](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aneeds%3Atriage) require an initial assessment and labeling.
- **Priority Issues**: The [Priority Label issues](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Apriority) are important and should be given attention over other issues.
