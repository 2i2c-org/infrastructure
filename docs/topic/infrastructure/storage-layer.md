# User home directory storage

All users on all the hubs get a home directory with persistent storage. This is made available through a Network File System [(NFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) that allows remote systems to access a storage resource over the network using a server-client model.

## NFS Server setup

Each of the 2i2c clusters has a NFS server that is usually located at `nfs-server-01`. This is currently hand configured, so it might change in the future. This NFS Server has a [persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/persistent-disk) that's independent from rest of the VM (it can be grown / snapshotted independently). This disk is mounted inside the NFS server at `/export/home-01` (for the home directories of users) and is made available via NFS to be mounted by everything in the cluster, via [`/etc/exports`](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/s1-nfs-server-config-exports):

```
/export/home-01 10.0.0.0/8(all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check,rw,sync)
```

```{note}
To SSH into the NFS server run:

    gcloud compute ssh nfs-server-01 --zone=us-central1-b
```

## NFS Client setup

For each hub, there needs to be a:

### Hub directory

A directory is created under `/export/home-01/homes` for each hub.
This the the base directory under which each hub has a directory ([`nfs.pv.baseShareName`](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L21)).
This is done through [a job](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/templates/nfs-share-creator.yaml) that's created for each deployment via [helm hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) that will mount `nfs.pv.baseShareName`, and make sure the directory for the hub is present on the NFS server with appropriate permissions.

```{note}
The NFS share creator job will be created pre-deploy, run, and cleaned up before deployment proceeds. Ideally, this would only happen once per hub setup - but we don't have a clear way to do that yet.
```

### Hub user mount

For each hub, [a PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC) and a PersistentVolume(PV)](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/templates/nfs.yaml) are created. This is the Kubernetes *Volume* that refers to the actual storage on the NFS server. The volume points to the hub directory created for the hub and user at `/export/home-01/homes/<hub-name>/<username>` (this name is dynamically determined as a combination of `nfs.pv.baseShareName` and the current release name). Z2jh then mounts the PVC on each user pod as a [volume named **home**](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/tree/HEAD/jupyterhub/files/hub/jupyterhub_config.py#L277).

Parts of the *home* volume are mounted in different places for the users:
   * [user home directories](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L100)

     Z2jh will mount into `/home/jovyan` (the mount path) the contents of the path `/exports/home-01/<hub-name>/<username>` on the NFS storage server. Note that `<username>` is specified as a `subPath` - the *subdirectory* **in the volume to mount** at that given location.

   * shared directories
        * [/home/jovyan/shared](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L106-L109)

          Mounted for **all users**, showing the contents of `/exports/home-01/homes/<hub-name>/_shared`. This mount is **readOnly** and users **can't** write to it.

        * [/home/jovyan/shared-readwrite](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L84-L86)

          Mounted **just for admins**, showing the contents of `/exports/home-01/homes/<hub-name>/_shared`. This volumeMount is **NOT readonly**, so admins can write to it.

          ```{note}
          This feature comes from the [custom KubeSpawner](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/HEAD/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L182) that the our community hubs use, that allows providing extra configuration for admin users only.
          ```
