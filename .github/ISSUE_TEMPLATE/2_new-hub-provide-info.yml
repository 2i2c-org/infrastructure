        # Hub user image

        It is possible to customize the user image for the hub, as long as the image is in a public registry. For example, a [quay.io registry image](https://quay.io/).
        See [the Infrastructure documentation on custom images](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/en/latest/howto/customize/custom-image.html) for more information.
        Use this section to fill in relevant information:

      label: Extra features you'd like to enable
      description: |
        In addition to a base JupyterHub, there are a few extra features that are possible. Use the checkboxes below to ask for them.
        These generally come with added complexity and cost, so make sure you've discussed these options with somebody at 2i2c before selecting them here.

        **Explanation of options**:
        - **Specific cloud provider or datacenter**: If you have restrictions about which cloud provider to use, and which data center the hub should live in (e.g. if it is next to a specific dataset).
        - **Dedicated Scalable Dask Cluster** with [Dask Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/): if you have very large datasets or otherwise need high-performance parallelizable computing via the cloud.
        - **Dedicated Kubernetes cluster**: If you need to run the infrastructure on your own cloud account, or otherwise wish to have a dedicated cluster.
      multiple: true
      options:
        - Specific cloud provider or datacenter (otherwise GCP)
        - Dedicated Kubernetes cluster
        - Scalable Dask Cluster
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: dropdown
    id: cloud-provider

      description: |
        If you selected the `Dedicated Kubernetes cluster` extra option and require a dedicated Kubernetes cluster
        on a cloud provider of your choice, please make sure the billing and cloud accounts are set up and enough permissions
        were granted to the 2i2c Engineers.
        Documentation about this topic can be found here https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/admin/howto/create-billing-account.html
      options:
        - I have read the docs and have setup the billing and cloud accounts
