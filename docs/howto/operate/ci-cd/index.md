# Automatic deployment with CI/CD

Most of our infrastructure automatically deploys and updates hubs via GitHub Workflows.
Different cloud providers may have specific pre-requisites to succeed at the automatic
deployment.

More information about our general CI/CD machinery is available in the [corresponding
reference section](/reference/ci-cd.md).

## Running the CI/CD machinery on each cloud provider

The following sections cover how to deploy hubs on the cloud providers that we support.
