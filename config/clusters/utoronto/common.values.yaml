              <h4>ARC will be making changes to our educational JupyterHub on January 9, 2023</h4>
              
              <p>R/RStudio will be moved off <a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca">jupyter.utoronto.ca</a>. R/RStudio will
              continue to be available through <a href="https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca">r.datatools.utoronto.ca</a> â€“ a
              separate RStudio hub. To make access to JupyterHub easier than ever, we will also consolidate the landing
              pages for our Jupyter Notebook and RStudio hubs into a single launch page:
              <a href="https://datatools.utoronto.ca">datatools.utoronto.ca</a>.</p>

              <p>For more information, please read <a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/updates-to-our-educational-jupyterhub/">our announcement</a>.</p>

              ongoing basis. To reach the support site, please visit: <a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support">https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/</a>.
