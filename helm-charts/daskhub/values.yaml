        #    mercy of how KubeSpawner renders our passed dictionaries.
        #
        # 2. Dask loads local YAML config.
        #
        # 3. Dask loads environment variables prefixed DASK_.
        #    - DASK_ is stripped
        #    - Capitalization is ignored
        #    - Double underscore means a nested configuration
        #    - `ast.literal_eval` is used to parse values
        #
        # 4. dask-gateway and dask-distributed looks at its config and expands
        #    expressions in {} again, sometimes only with the environment
        #    variables as context but sometimes also with additional variables.
