      # NOTE: About node sharing
      #
      #       CPU/Memory requests/limits are actively considered still. This
      #       profile list is setup to involve node sharing as considered in
      #       https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/2121.
      #
      #       - Memory requests are different from the description, based on:
      #         whats found to remain allocate in k8s, subtracting 1GiB
      #         overhead for misc system pods, and transitioning from GB in
      #         description to GiB in mem_guarantee
      #         https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/plan-node-sizes.
      #
      #       - CPU requests are lower than the description, with a factor
      #         that depends on the node's total CPU like: (node_cpu - 1)/node_cpu
      #
      #         The purpose of this is to ensure that we manage to schedule pods
      #         even if system pods have requested up to 1 CPU.
