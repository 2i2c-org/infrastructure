# Incident reports

The 2i2c infrastructure is constantly evolving. As people use our hubs, different issues often arise that result in new needs for development and updates to the deployment. 2i2c follows a process of transparent and blameless post-mortems to address these issues now, and prevent them from happening in the future.

Below is a list of issue reports for the 2i2c Hub infrastructure.
