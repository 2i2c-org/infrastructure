        For each hub to be deployed, copy the tables below and fill them in.
        The tables must be complete for each hub to be considered READY to be
        deployed. For a staging/prod pair, a statement such as "Same as staging
        but for production" will suffice for the prod hub's specification. Use
        the Notes column to provide any contextual information.
