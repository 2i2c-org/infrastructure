# Configure and deploy the `support` chart

The `support` chart is a helm chart maintained by the 2i2c Engineers that consists of common tools used to support JupyterHub deployments in the cloud.
These tools are [`ingress-nginx`](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/), for controlling ingresses and load balancing; [`cert-manager`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/), for automatically provisioning TLS certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/); [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), for scraping and storing metrics from the cluster and hub; and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), for visualising the metrics retrieved by Prometheus.

This section will walk you through how to deploy the support chart on a cluster.

```{attention}
If you ran `deployer generate dedicated-cluster ...` during the [new cluster setup](new-cluster),
then a lot of these files will have already been created for you and you do not
need to recreate them, only update them if required.
```

## Make sure `support.values.yaml` is correctly configured

In the `infrastructure` repo, the full filepath should be: `config/clusters/<cluster_name>/support.values.yaml`.

Checkout the template support values file in `config/clusters/templates/common/support.values.yaml` for an example configuration. If the cluster is running on GCP or AWS, the deployer should have been generated this file already.

If you are deploying the support chart on an Azure cluster, you **must** manually create such a file using the template mentioned above.

You must also set an annotation for `ingress-nginx`'s k8s Service resource.

Include the following in your `support.values.yaml` file:

```yaml
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    service:
      annotations:
        # This annotation is a requirement for use in Azure provided
        # LoadBalancer.
        #
        # ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ingress-basic?tabs=azure-cli#basic-configuration
        # ref: https://github.com/Azure/AKS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-2022-09-11
        # ref: https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/2907#issuecomment-1109759262
        # ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8501#issuecomment-1108428615
        #
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path: /healthz
```

## Edit your `cluster.yaml` file

Add the following config as a top-level key to your `cluster.yaml` file.
Note this filepath is _relative_ to the location of your `cluster.yaml` file.

```yaml
support:
  helm_chart_values_files:
    - support.values.yaml
```

(deploy-support-chart:manual)=
## Deploy the `support` chart via the `deployer`

Use the `deployer` tool to deploy the support chart to the cluster.
See [](hubs:manual-deploy) for details on how to setup the tool locally.

```bash
deployer deploy-support $CLUSTER_NAME
```

(deploy-support-chart:dns-records)=
## Setting DNS records

Once the `support` chart has been successfully deployed, retrieve the external IP address for the `ingress-nginx` load balancer.

```bash
deployer use-cluster-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME
```

```bash
kubectl --namespace=support get service support-ingress-nginx-controller
```

Add DNS records for the `2i2c.cloud` domain [under "Advanced DNS" in
Namecheap.com](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/2i2c.cloud/advancedns):

1. `<cluster-name>`, used for the primary hub (if it exists).
2. `*.<cluster-name>`, for all other hubs, grafana and prometheus
   instances.

Use an `A` record when we point to an external IP address (GCP, Azure), and a
`CNAME` record when we point to another domain (AWS).

```{note}
It may take a while for this configuration to propagate to all devices making
DNS lookups. After that, cert-manager needs to do its job to acquire HTTPS
certificates. And finally, the ingress-nginx server that makes use of the HTTPS
certificates needs to reload to use the acquired certificates.
```
