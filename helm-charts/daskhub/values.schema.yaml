# This schema (a jsonschema in YAML format) is used to generate
# values.schema.json which is, when available, used by the helm CLI for client
# side validation by Helm of the chart's values before template rendering.
#
# We look to document everything we have default values for in values.yaml, but
# we don't look to enforce the perfect validation logic within this file.
