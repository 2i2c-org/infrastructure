# AWS with NASA SMCE

NASA's [Science Managed Cloud Environment](https://smce.nasa.gov/) provides us with
AWS accounts where we can deploy JupyterHubs for their use. Thankfully, these are mostly
vanilla AWS accounts where we have proper permissions, but there are a couple of extra
points of interaction between the engineer setting up the hub and the community representative.

## Getting access to the account

This is very much the same as getting access to any other AWS account where billing
is handled for us by someone else.

1. The community representative will get in touch with SMCE to either provision a new
   AWS account, or grant us full access to one that already exists.

2. Once the community representative has access, they will create an
   IAM account for *one* 2i2c engineer in this account, and make sure
   they are a part of the `SMCE-ProjectAdmins` group.  This gives us
   full access to the AWS account, and we can add other engineers here.

3. This engineer should log in with the credentials provided by the community representative,
   and set up [Multi Factor Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/), using [this dashboard link](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-west-2#/security_credentials/mfa). 
   This is required in all SMCE environments. You need to log out of the AWS console and back in
   after setting up MFA to see your full permissions.

4. This engineer should now create user accounts for all other 2i2c engineers, and make sure
   they are all part of the `SMCE-ProjectAdmins` group.

Once this is done, steps for the regular [AWS Cluster Setup](new-cluster:aws) can proceed,
until completion of [provisioning credentials for CI/CD](new-cluster:aws:terraform:cicd).

## Getting a MFA exemption for our `hub-continuous-deployer` user

At the completion of [provisioning credentials for CI/CD](new-cluster:aws:terraform:cicd),
we will have a IAM user named `hub-continuous-deployer` provisioned. This is what we use to
deploy from GitHub actions, but also to deploy from our local machines. The MFA requirement
needs to be exempted for this user before we can continue and actually deploy our hubs.

The engineer needs to reach out to the community representative at this point, and ask
for the MFA exemption. `hub-continuous-deployer` has a very narrow scope of permissions - only
`eks:DescribeCluster` on the specific cluster we deployed. The community representative will
have to reach out via their own internal processes to grant this exemption. This has
always been granted so far - VEDA, GHG - and should not be a problem to get granted again.
We have also received assurances that this process would be expedited to the extent possible.

You can verify that this MFA exemption has been processed by looking at the list of groups
the `hub-continuous-deployer` user belongs to. It should *not* contain the user `SMCE-UserRestrictions`.

Once this exemption has been processed, you can continue as usual with deployment of the hub.

## Preparing for routine regeneration of the `hub-continuous-deployer` access credentials

The `hub-continuous-deployer` has an access key and secret associated with it, this is how it
authenticates with AWS to perform actions. SMCE accounts have a 60 day password/access key
regeneration policy and so we need to prepare to regularly regenerate this access key.

We track which clusters have had their `hub-continuous-dpeloyer` access key regenerated
and when in this issue <https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/2434> which
also includes the steps for regeneration. Make sure to add the new cluster to this issue.

```{warning}
We only receive **5 days notice** that a password/access key will expire via email!

Also it is unclear who receives this email: all engineers or just the engineer who
setup the cluster?
```
