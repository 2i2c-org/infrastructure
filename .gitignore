# Delete untracked files (-X), with required confirmation (-f), recursively (-d).

# This section handles sensitive content that is or isn't encrypted in our repo.

# Ignore files (but not directories) with secret in their name

# Don't ignore enc- prefixed files

# Don't ignore Helm chart templates with secret in their name as
# they are not supposed to contain sensitive content but can often
# have secret in their name.

# Ignore the .json version of our Helm chart's schema files so we only version
# control the .yaml file that we use to generate the .json file.

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
