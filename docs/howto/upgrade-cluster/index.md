# Upgrade Kubernetes clusters

How we upgrade a Kubernetes cluster is specific to the cloud provider. This
section covers topics in upgrading an existing Kubernetes cluster.

```{warning}
As of now, we have not yet established practices on when to upgrade our
Kubernetes clusters. Establishing this is tracked in [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/412).

As of now, we also only have written documentation for how to upgrade Kubernetes
clusters on AWS.
