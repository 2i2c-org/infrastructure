# Our CI/CD system

The best place to look to learn about the latest state of our *automatic* hub deployment
is to look at [the `deploy-hubs.yaml` GitHub workflow](https://github.com/2i2c-org/pilot-hubs/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-hubs.yaml).
That workflow defines the automatic hub deployment for many of our major clusters.

:::{note}
This is essentially a placeholder, it needs to be extended to talk a **lot** more about
our CI/CD system.
