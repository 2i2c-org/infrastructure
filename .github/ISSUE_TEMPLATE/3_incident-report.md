## What went wrong

_Things that could have gone better. Ideally these should result in concrete
action items that have GitHub issues created for them and linked to under
Action items._

- Thing one
- Thing two

## Where we got lucky

_These are good things that happened to us but not because we had planned for them._

- Thing one
- Thing two

## Follow-up actions

_Every action item should have a GitHub issue (even a small skeleton of one) attached to it, so these do not get forgotten. These issues don't have to be in `infrastructure/`, they can be in other repositories._
