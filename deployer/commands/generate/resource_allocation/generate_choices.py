    Generate choices for resource allocation based on proportional changes to memory

    Used primarily in research cases where:
    1. Workloads are more memory constrained than CPU constrained
    2. End users can be expected to select appropriate amount of memory they need for a given
       workload, either by their own intrinsic knowledge or instructed by an instructor.

    It features:
    1. No memory overcommit at all, as end users are expected to ask for as much memory as
       they need.
    2. CPU *guarantees* are proportional to amount of memory guarantee - the more memory you
       ask for, the more CPU you are guaranteed. This allows end users to pick resources purely
       based on memory only, simplifying the mental model. Also allows for maximum packing of
       user pods onto a node, as we will *not* run out of CPU on a node before running out of
       memory.
    3. No CPU limits at all, as CPU is a more flexible resource. The CPU guarantee will ensure
       that users will not be starved of CPU.
    4. Each choice the user can make approximately has half as many resources as the next largest
       choice, with the largest being a full node. This offers a decent compromise - if you pick
       the largest option, you will most likely have to wait for a full node spawn, while smaller
       options are much more likely to be shared.
