        This template is designed to help the engineers plan the recurrent task
        of generating and collecting in one place the billing data either for
        shared or for dedicated 2i2c clusters for a specific time interval.

        Once all the info has been filled in, this issue is considered to be
        fully refined and can be added to the `Refined` column of the Project
        Board.
