### Meeting goal and agenda 

<!-- Use the Team Compass meeting agendas to pre-populate the meeting plan: https://compass.2i2c.org/services/dedicated-delivery-management/ -->

### Participants requested

<!-- Typically the community's delivery partner and an engineer who's closely connected to the work; you can request any team member's participation, though -->

### Summary of decisions and actions

<!-- Capture appropriately detailed meeting notes and share them with the community; this section gives us a place to quickly notice what was decided and next steps in a way all team members can easily find 

Recommended meeting note procedure
- Create a Google doc and attach to the calendar invite
- Add the doc to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11lTumBp82pHOfcrh8hN3kHDw-0LDBCRG (which is shared with all 2i2c)
- Share with the community ahead of the meeting
- If the community contacts do not use Google Drive, send them the agenda as an email/in the invite and the notes as a Word doc or PDF after the call
