name: Comment Hub Deployment Plan to a Pull Request

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows:
      - "Deploy and test hubs"
    types:
      - "completed"

jobs:
  # This job downloads artifacts generated by the "Deploy and test hubs" workflow.
  # The artifacts generated are two files: one containing the Pull Request number of the
  # run, and a second containing Markdown tables detailing which hubs will be upgraded as
  # a result of merging a Pull Request. This Markdown content will be posted to the
  # Pull Request as a comment. This means that no-one has to go searching through
  # GitHub Actions logs to see if the hubs they intended to be upgraded, will be
  # upgraded. The job posts the comment in a 'Netlify style', i.e., if a comment has
  # already been posted (identified as having the 'github-actions[bot]' author and
  # '<!-- deployment-plan -->' string in the body), the existing comment will be
  # updated rather than posting a new one.
