      description: |
        It is possible to customize the user image for the hub, as long as the image is in a public registry.
        For example, a [quay.io registry image](https://quay.io/).
        See [the Infrastructure documentation on custom images](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/en/latest/howto/customize/custom-image.html) for more information.

    attributes:
      label: Extra features you'd like to enable
      description: |
        In addition to a base JupyterHub, there are a few extra features that are possible. Use the checkboxes below to ask for them.
        These generally come with added complexity and cost, so make sure you've discussed these options with somebody at 2i2c before selecting them here.

        **Explanation of options**:
        - **Specific cloud provider or datacenter**: If you have restrictions about which cloud provider to use, and which data center the hub should live in (e.g. if it is next to a specific dataset).
        - **Dedicated Scalable Dask Cluster** with [Dask Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/): if you have very large datasets or otherwise need high-performance parallelizable computing via the cloud.
        - **Dedicated Kubernetes cluster**: If you need to run the infrastructure on your own cloud account, or otherwise wish to have a dedicated cluster.
      value: |
        - [ ] Specific cloud provider or datacenter: <!-- Specify which if yes -->
        - [ ] Dedicated Kubernetes cluster
        - [ ] Scalable Dask Cluster
