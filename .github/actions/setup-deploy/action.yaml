# This is a _local composite GitHub action_ that helps us reuse CI logic across
# different workflows and jobs by referencing this action in a job's step.
#
# > A composite action allows you to combine multiple workflow steps within one
# > action.
#
# This local action can be referenced like this from a job:
#
#   steps:
#     - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-deploy
#       with:
#         provider: gcp
#         GCP_KMS_DECRYPTOR_KEY: ${{ secrets.GCP_KMS_DECRYPTOR_KEY }}

name: "Setup the deployer script for use to deploy"
description: >-
  Setups the deployer script by loading credentials and installing library
  dependencies and relevant tools needed to interact with encrypted files,
  kubernetes clusters, and container registries. `gcloud` already available in
  the github virtual environment is not re-installed but `helm` is pinned to
  avoid issues of a changing version.
