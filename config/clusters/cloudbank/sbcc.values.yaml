        # WARNING: Don't use allow_existing_users with config to allow an
        #          externally managed group of users, such as
        #          GitHubOAuthenticator.allowed_organizations, as it breaks a
        #          common expectations for an admin user.
        #
        #          The broken expectation is that removing a user from the
        #          externally managed group implies that the user won't have
        #          access any more. In practice the user will still have
        #          access if it had logged in once before, as it then exists
        #          in JupyterHub's database of users.

        # WARNING: Removing a user from admin_users or allowed_users doesn't
        #          revoke admin status or access.
        #
        #          OAuthenticator.allow_existing_users allows any user in the
        #          JupyterHub database of users able to login. This includes
        #          any previously logged in user or user previously listed in
        #          allowed_users or admin_users, as such users are added to
        #          JupyterHub's database on startup.
        #
        #          To revoke admin status or access for a user when
        #          allow_existing_users is enabled, first remove the user from
        #          admin_users or allowed_users, then deploy the change, and
        #          finally revoke the admin status or delete the user via the
        #          /hub/admin panel.
