# This is a _local composite GitHub action_ that helps us reuse CI logic across
# different workflows and jobs by referencing this action in a job's step.
#
# > A composite action allows you to combine multiple workflow steps within one
# > action.
#
# This local action can be referenced like this from a job:
#
#   steps:
#     - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-deploy
#       with:
#         provider: gcp
#
# General action configuration reference:
