      # This workflow is triggered by PR opening/reopening.
      # But because we use this workflow as a required workflow for other repositories
      # in the 2i2c organization, it is **expected** to run successfully
      # for each PR commit in those repositories.

      # So we add an extra echo step that will make the job run
      # even if the assignation action step skips.
