# Enable cost attribution systems

This documentation is about enabling automatic cost attribution systems for
various cloud providers. This is different from the manual accounting we've
performed for shared and dedicated clusters that we pay the cloud bill for.

Currently we only have a automatic cost attribution system for AWS. For details
on the progress of the other cloud providers, see [the larger initiative issue].
